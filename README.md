##What is this?

JUIT Doctrine Extensions is a package that provides addional functionality for the [PHP ORM Doctrine](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2).

Currently it just consists of an additional DBAL type that normalizes datetime fields to UTC and back. Its implementation is heavily inspired by a [proposal within the Doctrine Cookbook](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/2.0.x/cookbook/working-with-datetime.html).
